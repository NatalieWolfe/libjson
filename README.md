libjson
=======

A fork of http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjson/ aiming to clean up the library and bring C++11
features to it. The C compatibility is not maintained.

Goals
-----

1. Eliminate namespace and preprocessor pollution.
2. Add modern C++ features (move constructors, initialization_vector support)
3. Make source code more readable.
4. Provide amalgamation header and source files for easy importing to existing projects.
